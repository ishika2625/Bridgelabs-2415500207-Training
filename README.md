🚀 Bridgelabz Java Learning Journey — 2415500207

Welcome to my Java Training Log & Practice Repository, created as part of the Bridgelabz 2025 program.
This repository documents my continuous growth in Java — with each branch representing a dedicated learning module, organized for clarity, revision, and real-world application.

🌿 Branch-Wise Learning Structure

Each branch in this repository focuses on a specific Java concept or module.
This keeps the learning path clean, modular, and easy to navigate.

| Branch Name              | What It Covers                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **java-core**            | Basics of Java: syntax, variables, operators, loops, arrays (1D & 2D), strings, logic building                     |
| **java-oops**            | Object-Oriented Programming: classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation |
| **packages-in-java**     | Organizing Java code using packages, imports, access modifiers, modular programming                                |
| **wrapper-class**        | Wrapper classes, autoboxing/unboxing, conversions between primitives and objects                                   |
| **functional-interface** | Functional interfaces, default/static methods, lambda usage, marker interfaces, interface design                   |
| **lambda-expression**    | Practical use-cases of lambda expressions, method references, concise functional coding                            |
| **error-and-exception**  | Exception handling, checked vs unchecked exceptions, custom exceptions, try/catch/finally, throw/throws            |

This log tracks my learning in weekly blocks, highlighting concepts explored and problems solved.
